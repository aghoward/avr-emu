# avr-emu

avr-emu is a hobby project implementing the AVR instruction set as in an
emulator. It is not complete yet and needs a lot of work.


## But why though?

This is a hobby project. I have never taken the time to learn AVR at the
assembly language but I have plenty of the chips lying around. I usually program
these in C++; but was recently inspired to start this project by watching [Dave
Poo's YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLwK93hM93Z13TRzPx9JqTIn33feefl37)
on implementing a 6502 emulator in C++.

Mostly though, this is fun and informational for me. While I am a professional
software engineer you should not expect anything to come from this project nor
for it to be useful to you. You can only expect confidence in this code as far
as the tests cover it (and I'm being dilligent about writing tests).
